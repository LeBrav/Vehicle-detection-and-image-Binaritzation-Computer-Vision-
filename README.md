# Vehicle detection and image Binaritzation (Computer Vision)
The objective of this project is to obtain a binarized video detecting cars passing by a road. To do so, I've worked with 150 frames captured in a road, and with basic image treatment, like background subtraction with median operations, and different thresholds to binarize image. I've also improved the binarized result frames by doing binary morphology.

I've developed both .py (Python) and .m (Matlab) code in this project.
